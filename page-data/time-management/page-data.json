So my friends and I came up with this idea where we created a google calendar where we put in tasks that we really want to get done.</p>\n<p>For each task in our calendar, we always check up with each other to see how we are doing and that the task actually gets completed. By knowing that my friends are going to message me, it makes me feel pretty motivated and since it’s my friends I don’t want to let them down. To make sure this is sustainable, we made a rule where we can only put 1 to 2 tasks per day because if it’s too time consuming no one would want to do it. Due to the limited the number of tasks, we often use it to put our daily highlights there.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Daily highlight</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So this concept is super simple but I find it to be super effective. Each day I have a daily highlight which is basically the most important task I want to get done that day. Even if I get nothing else done it still allows me to be satisfied with my day. Additionally, once I complete my daily highlight, it usually gives me the momentum to help me complete everything else.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Habit Tracking</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is definitely the best way to be help you manage any habits you want to be consistent with.  The reason why I love habit trackers is that they are extremely effective. If I don’t a complete a habit for awhile I have to keep checking it off as red which bothers me a lot because it shows that I’ve been lazy on that particular habit which gives me motivation to resume my habit again. On the other hand, if I’ve been completing my habit everyday, it feels super satisfying and it creates a streak that I don’t want to break.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Self Reflection Study Sessions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Pomodoro technique is basically where you study for 25 min and take a 5 min break or study for 50 min and take a 10 min break. To further improve my studying efficiency, after each session is over I reflect on how each session went. This allows to learn more what I need to do study better and create an environment that I need to thrive. There are 4 main factors that I look at to see how productive I actually was while studying.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Time Management Tips","date":"January 10, 2022","description":"Using my experiences I've learned throughout University, I'll dive a little bit into how I manage my day and also some productivity techniques I really enjoy using.","category":"Productivity"}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/power-of-accountability/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Power of Accountability","category":"Productivity"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7194fc25-6e6c-56c1-afe8-a7885d400f0b","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"347c7759-345a-532f-bde2-4eab69648bca"}},
