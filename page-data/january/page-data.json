We got to essentially reflect on how 2021 has been for each of us and it opened room for conservations we usually don’t get to have.</li>\n<li>Made my new years resolution to start off the year strong.</li>\n<li>Updated my monthly habit tracker to make sure it corresponds with my New Years Goals.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 2</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Today, along with my family, I went to Ottawa to pick up my things from when I lived there during my last co-op term. My cousin and her husband who was there, treated us to Popeyes so the food was delicious.</li>\n<li>Finished listening to the audio book, “Think Like a Monk” by Jay Shetty. It was such an amazing book and it gave me additional clarity on how I want to live my life.</li>\n<li>Once we were home, I set up my computer and it feels good to have it again compared to my laptop.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 3</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Started practicing piano again! I’ve been avoiding it for quite some time now due to other responsibilities but I’m happy I managed to make time for it</li>\n<li>As I’m still on break, I got to enjoy my day by playing League of Legends with my brothers and cousins.</li>\n<li>I started a new book called “Outliers: The Story of Success” by Malcolm Gladwell, and so far it’s pretty exciting.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 4</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>I woke up at 6am today! I finally fixed my sleep schedule and starting the day in the morning substantially increased my productivity.</li>\n<li>My mom had a high workload for her immigration business and I was able to help lessen her load by doing data entry.</li>\n<li>Got in my exercise for the day which was cardio.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 5</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Realized that I should always follow a schedule whenever I want to get things done. This is much better than the alternative of doing things in the moment as there’s a higher chance that I’ll get distracted from my what I want to do.</li>\n<li>I do 10 min of typing practice a day and I can tell that my speed is slowly increasing. I’m able to reach speeds of over 100 WPM now.</li>\n<li>Had lots of fun playing osu, a computer rhythm game.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 6</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>My motivation to go to the gym was extremely low but that didn’t stop me from exercising today.</li>\n<li>Finished replying to LetterLoop, which is a series of engaging that I answer and talk about with my friends.</li>\n<li>I spent a good chunk of my day wasting my time, but I managed to spend the remainder of my day doing productive and meaningful activities.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 7</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Held myself more accountable today by sharing my Google Calendar to others.</li>\n<li>Took a new approach to the side project that I’m working on.</li>\n<li>Completed 80% of my habits today.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 8</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Continued reading “Outliers” by Malcolm Gladwell. I really like how he talks about how people don’t become successful purely due to hard work but also due to the opportunities that are given to them.</li>\n<li>As it was the weekend, I had fun playing League of Legends.</li>\n<li>I can tell that my piano skills are slowly improving the more I practice.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 9</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>After our family attended church, we got to have a good discussion together as a family. I really enjoy these times as it’s an opportunity where everyone in our family gets to speak and is open with one another.</li>\n<li>My friend gave me a custom mouse pad as a belated birthday gift! It was such an amazing gift as it was also One Piece themed and matched my computer set up.</li>\n<li>I updated my Notion template. I’m extremely happy with how it turned out and this makes me more excited to use it on a daily basis.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 10</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Got to save a little bit of money as I changed one of monthly subscriptions to the yearly option.</li>\n<li>As I’m coming back from the winter break, I’m slowly getting used to studying again. Eventually I’ll be able to go back to my natural rhythm of things.</li>\n<li>Brainstormed lots of amazing ideas of how I want to create my website.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 11</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>I almost finished one of my assignments! This is due in 2 weeks and yet I already 70% of the content.</li>\n<li>Started using the Alarmy App to help me wake up early in the morning and start being productive.</li>\n<li>Finished what I needed to do so I relaxed the evening by playing League of Legends.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 12</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Found a new site called Optimize Me which gives thoughtful summaries for self help books and other topics to help you succeed in life.</li>\n<li>My motivation was still low today but I managed to practice piano and continue exercising.</li>\n<li>Learned about Gatsby and how the bootstrapping process works.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 13</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Started listening to audio books again. This saves me so much time as I can still do other tasks while listening to the book.</li>\n<li>The book I started listening to was “Man’s Search for Meaning” by Viktor Frankl. So far it’s such an amazing book and I love learning about his perspectives on life, success, and happiness.</li>\n<li>Finished my economics quiz and I feel pretty good with how it went.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 14</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>I realized that listening to an audio book gives me an incentive to exercise more as there aren’t that many other tasks that I can do while listening.</li>\n<li>Updated my Cold Turkey Blocker settings to reduce my distractions and help me enter a state of deep focus throughout the day.</li>\n<li>Made a contract my friends to finish my side project before a certain deadline.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>January 15</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>I managed to enter a state of deep focus for 6 hours today.

There is still some more elements that need to be added but I’m super satisfied with the progress I’ve made.</li>\n<li>Some of my cousins came over and it was a lot of fun just hanging out with them. My Dad also ordered pizza for all of us so we had a nice meal together.</li>\n<li>My average phone screen time from last week was 29 minutes.
