### January 1

1. As it was the start of 2022, I got to have an amazing discussion with my family. We got to essentially reflect on how 2021 has been for each of us and it opened room for conservations we usually don't get to have.

3. Updated my monthly habit tracker to make sure it corresponds with my New Years Goals.

3. Got in my exercise for the day which was cardio.

2. My friend gave me a custom mouse pad as a belated birthday gift! It was such an amazing gift as it was also One Piece themed and matched my computer set up.
