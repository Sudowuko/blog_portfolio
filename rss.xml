&lt;p&gt;‚Äúwhat we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore‚Äîplays in defining the quality of our life.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic, I used to be the student who lived in the library. That is how I entered a study environment and started my work. However, once the pandemic hit, the libraries closed and school became online. At first, it was nearly impossible for me to study for even 10 minutes without experiencing a distraction. Now, 2 to 3 years later, I learned how to overcome my distractions and I can focus for up to 3 to 4 hours without taking a single break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 Minute Rule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often the hardest part of studying is getting started. For me personally, if the work I have to do is overwhelming then it can cause fear and anxiety which leads to procrastination. The 5 minute rules helps target this aspect of procrastination and it essentially shows you that the work is not scary as you think it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way it works is that you make a goal to focus for only 5 minutes and after those 5 minutes are up, you are allowed to stop. This doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but this allows you to gain momentum and by the time your 5 minutes are up, the work I‚Äôm doing no longer feels scary and I don‚Äôt want to stop since I just started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may not know if I can actually complete the work I have for the day, but I do know that I can work for 5 minutes and then keep going from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distraction Journal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While studying, sometimes random thoughts appear in my mind to prevent from me studying. For example, one time I was studying and I looked at my trashcan and saw that it was full. It gave me a sudden urge to stop what I‚Äôm doing and take out the trash. I don‚Äôt want to ignore it because I might forget later on and it‚Äôs a super quick task so what‚Äôs the harm? I took out the trash, went back to my room, and then I no longer felt like doing work. I lost my studying momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I use a distraction journal for situations like these. If I have a sudden urge to do something, I just write it down in my journal and then go back to work. It sounds super simple but writing those things down helps you avoid thinking them which allows you to focus on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Blocker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sites such as YouTube and Instagram, they are deliberately designed for maximum distraction. So it‚Äôs no surprise whenever I go on YouTube and find myself spending hours of my day watching random YouTube videos. Even if I try to stay away using sheer willpower, I often find myself coming back to those sites again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using web blockers, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much willpower I have. It‚Äôs impossible for me to be distracted by sites that I do not have access to. If something is blocked, the urge for me to access those sites also disappears. Now I can preserve my willpower for something more meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Power of Accountability]]></title><description><![CDATA[‚ÄúI believe that accountability is the basis of all meaningful human achievement.‚Äù Sam Silverstein Whenever I find myself in a slump and I‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://gatsbystarterblogsource.gatsbyjs.io/power-of-accountability/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsbystarterblogsource.gatsbyjs.io/power-of-accountability/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI believe that accountability is the basis of all meaningful human achievement.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Silverstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I find myself in a slump and I don‚Äôt want to do anything, I often ask my friends and family for help to give me the push that I need. I found that whenever I ask for someone to keep my accountable, my productivity skyrockets and I‚Äôm able to achieve things that I never thought were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practical Ways to Keep Yourself Accountable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With someone close to you, ask them for a quick favour. Make a contract that publicly states if you don‚Äôt complete X task, then you‚Äôll receive Y consequence. For example, I once told my friends that if I don‚Äôt finish my assignment before a certain time period, then I‚Äôll give them a monetary reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing this, my motivation has increased substantially which allows me to get my work done. Even if you end up violating your contract, the work you get done is often higher than it would have been if you didn‚Äôt make a contract in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accountability Partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, by having someone who can always keep you accountable, that helps motivate you to keep the work you need. On a daily or weekly basis, an accountability partner can be someone who talks to you about what your goals are and then check up on you after a certain period of time to see how you‚Äôre doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I know that someone will check up on me, it essentially forces me to do my work.  Unless I had a valid excuse, it is often pretty painful to say that I didn‚Äôt finish what I wanted and it‚Äôs even worse if it because of laziness. I don‚Äôt want to tell them I did nothing because I was lazy as that would be letting them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared Habit Trackers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a habit tracker, I find them most accountable when you show your progress towards others. I don‚Äôt want people to see a long streak of my incomplete habits, so the only option I have that is left is to put in the work and stay consistent with my habits. This also gives me the incentive I need to complete my habits because I want to be able to show and be proud of my accomplishments that I‚Äôm able to stay consistent with the habits that I want in my life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Time Management Tips]]></title><description><![CDATA[Shared Google Calendar This is my favourite time management tool, and I would say it was pretty life changing.

&lt;li&gt;Shared Google Calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favourite time management tool, and I would say it was pretty life changing. My friends and I came up with this idea where we created a google calendar where we put in tasks that we really want to get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each task in our calendar, we always check up with each other to see how we are doing and that the task actually gets completed. By knowing that my friends are going to message me, it makes me feel pretty motivated and since it‚Äôs my friends I don‚Äôt want to let them down. To make sure this is sustainable, we made a rule where we can only put 1 to 2 tasks per day because if it‚Äôs too time consuming no one would want to do it. Due to the limited the number of tasks, we often use it to put our daily highlights there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily highlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this concept is super simple but I find it to be super effective. Each day I have a daily highlight which is basically the most important task I want to get done that day. Even if I get nothing else done it still allows me to be satisfied with my day. Additionally, once I complete my daily highlight, it usually gives me the momentum to help me complete everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Habit Tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely the best way to be help you manage any habits you want to be consistent with.  The reason why I love habit trackers is that they are extremely effective. If I don‚Äôt a complete a habit for awhile, I have to keep checking it off as red which bothers me a lot because it shows that I‚Äôve been lazy on that particular habit which gives me motivation to resume my habit again. On the other hand, if I‚Äôve been completing my habit everyday, it feels super satisfying and it creates a streak that I don‚Äôt want to break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self Reflection Study Sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pomodoro technique is basically where you study for 25 min and take a 5 min break or study for 50 min and take a 10 min break. To further improve my studying efficiency, after each session is over I reflect on how each session went. This allows to learn more what I need to do study better and create an environment that I need to thrive. There are 4 main factors that I look at to see how productive I actually was while studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus level (1 to 10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What went well?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What went wrong?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could I improve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
